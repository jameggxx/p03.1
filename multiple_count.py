Problem:

    The function mult_count takes an integer n.
    It should count the number of multiples of 5, 7 and 11 between 1 and n (including n).
    Numbers such as 35 (a multiple of 5 and 7) should only be counted once.

    e.g.
    mult_count(20) = 7  (5, 10, 15, 20; 7, 14; 11)

Tests:

    >>> mult_count(20)
    7
    >>> mult_count(50)
    20
    >>> mult_count(250)
    93
